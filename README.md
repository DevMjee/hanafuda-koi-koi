# hanafuda-koi-koi
A simulation of the koi koi card game in Python.

Must Have Requirements:
* Build Class Objects for the hanafuda cards, including inheritance e.g. for cards in the same month.
* Encode a koi koi strategy into a bot which can consistently achieve success in the game.
* Create a simulation for koi koi with a human player against the bot.
  
Should Have Requirements:
* Create varying levels of the bot player (e.g. easy, medium, hard, impossible)
* Tutorial/Explanation of game rules.

Nice to Have Requirements:
* Experiment with simulating games other than koi koi (e.g. hawaiian hanafuda) using the same objects.
* Nicely printed displays to easily read and manage the cards and their properties.
* Networking to allow to separate devices to play together.
* AI trained players trained on ruleset
